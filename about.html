    </p>
    <h3>Me, Myself, & I</h3>
    <p>
      I'm an Electronics and Communication Engineering undergrad with a deep-rooted passion for low-level systems, semiconductors, and hardware-software co-design.
      My work bridges the gap between bare-metal programming and silicon, with hands-on experience across Python, C, C++, ARM Assembly, CUDA, Verilog, and SystemVerilog.
      I actively build compute libraries, design digital circuits, and implement RISC-V cores from scratch.
    </p>
    <p>
      I operate primarily in a Linux-first environment (WSL2 Ubuntu), using Vim as my weapon of choice. From vectorized GPU kernels to HDL-based ALUs, my projects reflect a strong bias for efficiency, control, and minimalism.
      I believe in understanding systems from the ground up â€” whether it's writing a Python C extension or handcrafting an instruction set in Verilog.
    </p>
    <p>
      Currently diving deeper into VLSI design, CPU/GPU microarchitecture, and high-performance computation.
